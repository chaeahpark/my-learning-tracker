##Things covered
1. Read Eloquent Javascript (Javascript and the browser)
2. Built a book list with a [Traversy Media tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMCxVWtW58)
3. Created My Leaning Tracker repo. It was inspired from [the article by Syk Houdeib](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-switched-careers-and-got-a-developer-job-in-10-months-a-true-story-b8895e855a8b/)

##Things need to touch again
1. There are several syntax which were new to me. I will cover them tomorrow.
- createTextNode()
- insertBefore()
- getItem()
- setItem()
- splice()
- JSON.stringify()

2. Go through the code of the book list project and try to tweak and improve it.
